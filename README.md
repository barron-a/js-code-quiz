# JavaScript Fundamentals Code Quiz

## Description

JavaScript Fundamentals Code Quiz is a web app that prompts users with a series of basic questions about JavaScript that must be completed in a set amount of time. For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from the quiz timer. When complete, the app provides the user a score and an opportunity to enter their initials to track high scores. This data is stored to the user's local storage with a submit button and redirects them to a high scores page. The user can also access the high scores page from the home page, and can clear high scores from local storage on this page.
